# Gale-Shapley algorithm implementation in Python

## Introduction
This code was written for my Algorithm Design class taught by Dr. C Kirbas at University of Dayton.

The input file contains key:value pair with the preferences of the men and women that need to be matched.

To maintain simplicity all the men and women have been assigned an unique ID. Men have been assigned even numbers : [0,2,4..] Women have been assigned odd numbers : [1,3,5,..].

## Usage
* To invoke the program run : python MainController.py <integer number>

        eg: python MainController.py 5

* To generate random preference for n men and women run : python CreatePreferenceList.py <integer number>

        eg: python CreatePreferenceList.py 5
